## Introduction

A webpage designed for young enterpreneurs and student freelancers who seek to expand
their portfolios by offering their services at a discounted price point or for free in local communities.
The website services are aimed at people who are having problems affording these services at regular prices (like healthcare, photo sessinons). The lower price's purpose is to make it easier to get access to a service and
let young people earn experience needed in the modern job market. It also helps boost the local economy.
